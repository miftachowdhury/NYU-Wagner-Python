# _Analyzing Stop and Frisk Data_
# An analysis by the NYCLU revealed that innocent New Yorkers have been subjected to police stops and street interrogations more than 5 million times since 2002, and that black and Latino communities continue to be the overwhelming target of these tactics. Nearly nine out of 10 stopped-and-frisked New Yorkers have been completely innocent.
# The defenders of Stop & Frisk have said that the stops have been random and as such they've been able to reduce the crime rates in the city. However, you feel that you the arrests have been leveled in an unfair manner and more so against black people in the city. 
# As such you set out to investigate this and look at the stop and frisk data from 2003 - 2017. The data is provided as excel files in the NYPD website below:
# You are certainely interested in establishing whether,  for the arrests that didn't lead to an arrest (where no offense was found), was the choice to stop the subject random or not. In this analysis, you will  have to consider the population of NYC as found in the census website below.
# Your task is to come up with the statistic and the model needed to find out whether the stop and frisk program could actually be biased in its treatment of NYC's black population. Could it be biased? Or it is as random as the NYPD claims?
