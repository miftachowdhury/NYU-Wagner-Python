# Analysis of NYC Stop and Frisk Data

An analysis by the NYCLU revealed that innocent New Yorkers have been subjected to police stops and street interrogations more than 5 million times since 2002, and that black and Latino communities continue to be the overwhelming target of these tactics. Nearly nine out of 10 stopped-and-frisked New Yorkers have been completely innocent. Defenders of stop and frisk have argued that the stops have been random. 

Using data for 2003 - 2017, this analysis develops a statistic and model to determine whether stop and frisk was biased in its treatment of NYC's black population, or if the NYPD's claim that stops are random is valid.
