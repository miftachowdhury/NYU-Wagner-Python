       "  'description': 'Despite predictions throughout the twentieth century that modernization and secularization went hand in hand with an inevitable decline of religion, the so-called “return of religion” in the late twentieth century called this thesis into question. Political and social shifts of the twenty first century have made it even more clear that to understand our world—its past, present, and future—we must understand religion. But what do we mean when we say religion has “returned” and what do we mean by “religion”? Is it a set of practices, a belief system, an ethnicity, or a cultural identity? This course will be based around the complex and ultimately unanswerable question, “what do we study when we study ‘religion’?” The course will include discussion of major world religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—as well as new religious movements, magic, atheism, and religious identifications such as “spiritual but not religious.” We will discuss religious studies as an academic discipline, the history of religion, sociological and anthropological approaches, the psychology of religion, feminist theory, the idea of “lived religion,” topics within popular culture and religion, and recent political characterizations and debates. Readings may include works by Tala Asad, Graham Harvey, William James, Mircea Eliade, J. Z. Smith, Robert Orsi, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Saba Mahmood, Charles Taylor, Russell McCutcheon, Jeffrey Stout,<strong> </strong>and Michael Warner.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': \"By giving us a sense of place, the city we inhabit recreates us. This documentary photography course explores New York City as the ever-changing environment in which we are involved. Embarking on a photographic project of their design, students depict a highly visible urban space (viewed as a world financial, cultural, artistic capital) through their own relationship to it: their ways of interacting, acting, and being moved. Classes prepare students to work on their position as photographers: as they make pictures in the streets of New York, they determine their own perception (vantage point, angle, point of view, framing) and establish a particular relationship with the audience (through scale, rhythm sequence, position, color). Exploring the boundaries between public and private space, feeling space and scale with the body (and not only with one's eyes) and creating a personal color palette are strongly encouraged. Students also explore a photographer's power to change audience perception, for example, through large scale installations inciting viewers to inhabit particular vantage points. Though documentary imagery is traditionally considered to establish a transparent relation to 'reality,' this course challenges students to recognize its created character and to recreate the city by influencing with their photographic intervention the ways it is perceived. Classes are highly collaborative, offering technical instruction, critiques of student work, debates on street photography, visual analysis and discussions with invited artists. Open to highly motivated students with or without experience in documentary photography; digital or film cameras welcome. \\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This course uses social analysis, political speeches, and fiction to explore the relation of race-making, nation-building, and story-telling in the case of the United States. Our broadest premise is that collective subjects (nations, peoples, classes, religions, races) are formed and reformed thorugh narratives and collective action. Our specific premise is that \"American\" nationhood has been formed by racial domination and opposition to it, as represented in contesting narratives. Our goal is two-fold: to assess racialized nationalism in its historic and recent iterations, but also to assess how it is contested differently by scholarly treatises, political speeches, and works of literary and cinematic invention. Part one uses social analysis to explore the intersections entwining settler colonialism, chattel slavery, and immigration restriction, in forming American society and an imagined (\"American\") national community. the practice and meaning of democracy has been set by white supremacy in each regard, but democracy has also been enlarged and remade by social movements and counter-narratives that re-conceive the meaning of both race and nation. Part Two thus uses speeches by activists to clarify the debates in the civil rights era about the goals, means and stories that define effective social change. Part Three compares how fictions in literature and film represent the relation of race, nation, and democratic possibility. Authors include James Baldwin, Toni Morrisoon, Colson Whitehead, Claudia Rankine. Theorists include Michael Rogin, Audra Simpson, Mae Ngai, Hortense Spillers, Saidiyah Hartman, Frank Wilderson, Fred Moten. Films include Bamboozled, GET OUT, and Black Panther. \\n\\n',\n",

We will survey this history by considering the evolving idea of ‘the world’ itself, from Enlightenment articulations to studies of the world economy to crucial 20th century and contemporary interventions, tracing the shifting meanings of 'the world’ in relation to contemporaneous works that have been seen as representative of 'World Literature.’ In the last third of the semester we will read and discuss recent novels and critical studies engaged with modern understandings of the term 'World Literature.’ Fictional texts will include works by Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Nadine Gordimer, Franz Kafka, Arundhati Roy, and Zadie Smith.

       "  'description': '“If you put on anarchist glasses,\" writes political scientist James C. Scott in his book Two Cheers for Anarchism, “and look at the history of popular movements, revolutions, ordinary politics and the state from that angle, certain insights will appear that are obscured from almost any other angle.” Using an “anarchist squint,” Scott argues, allows us to better understand more clearly informal order, submerged politics, informal regulation of markets and commons, resistance to the state, subversion of legal regimes, and other topics. In can show us, in other words, the ways that people have built order, regulated their lives, and resisted domination in ways outside and against the state. The idea of this seminar is to adopt such an “anarchist squint” and take anarchism as method for students’ varied work. We will spend the term reading scholarship about communities, property, the state, law, and power to test the utility of an “anarchist squint” for our own work. Authors may include Scott, Colin Ward, Patricia Erick and Susan Silby, Elinor Ostrom, David Graeber, and others. Familiarity or affinity with political anarchism are unnecessary but welcome.',\n",

While somewhat privileged in terms or race and class, the protagonists of these books find their artistic and intellectual ambitions shaped and thwarted by the limitations of gender at every turn. And through these characters (or so \\xa0<em>Madwoman</em>\\xa0 argued) the authors expressed their own struggles—as “women”--to find a public voice when few women enjoyed the right to vote, attend university, own property, or sign contracts. In addition to these novels and \\xa0<em>Madwoman</em>\\xa0 itself, we will read selected poetry by Plath, Emily Dickinson, and Audre Lorde; essays on “women artists” by Eliot and Linda Nochlin; and critical responses by by Gayatri Spivak, bell hooks, and Susan Fraiman.

The tutorial group meets regularly throughout the semester, and students follow a common syllabus: all participants complete the same readings, write papers on similar topics, etc. Students in the same tutorial must register for the same number of credits. Credit is determined by the amount of work (readings and other types of assignments) and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Tutorials range from 2 to 4 credits.

Participants develop a solo performance through a series of exercises using memory, movement and written and visual imagery, and explore the associative strategies of collage and pastiche as methodologies for structuring material. The solos emerge from a process involving improvisation (movement and text), composing, and revision of material. Readings include performance texts by prominent artists, essays on performance, and video viewings, which foreground the tendency in performance to explore subjectivity and identity in light of social and political critique. Required texts include Jo Bonney’s \\xa0<em>Extreme Exposure</em>\\xa0, C. Carr\\'s \\xa0<em>On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century</em>\\xa0, and Lenora Champagne’s \\xa0<em>Out from Under: Texts by Women Performance Artists</em>\\xa0. Additional readings include Colin Counsell, \"Postmodernism and Performance Art,\" Roselee Goldberg, \"Performance: A Hidden History,\" Jonathan Kalb, \"Documentary Solo Performance: The Politics of the Mirrored Self,\" and an essay by Coco Fusco. Assignments include a solo performance created from the material developed in class (rather than \"polishing\" an already created piece), along with a written analysis of two live solo performances, and an oral presentation.

Over seven thousand miles of sewers undergird the five boroughs of New York; centuries of occluded catastrophe dictate the architectural fabric of modern London; and in metropolises around the world the labor of an unacknowledged precariat lets us pass through the urban everyday without reflection. This course looks at how these invisible cities are made visible through literature. We’ll grapple with the pathological, the potential, the evanescent, and even the scatological, as we ask how literature maps on to hidden registers of the built environment. Alongside conventional exercises in essay writing, research, and in-class presentations, students can expect to put theory into practice with assignments involving urban exploration, literary fieldwork, and urban audition. Writing requirements will include formal papers responding to readings; an exploration journal linking texts and experiences; construction of a city itinerary (and corresponding reaction to a classmate’s); and a final research project (which can, with permission, incorporate creative elements). Events at the Morbid Anatomy Museum and excursions with the Atlas Obscura collective may be arranged.

       "  'description': 'Science studies scholars traditionally think about knowledge: how it is produced, validated, translates across domains (or not), and intersects with other aspects of social, material, cultural, and political life. Yet, the doing of science can produce more than just knowledge. The term “agnotology” describes the production of ignorance, and the study of that production. While ignorance is often contrasted as the opposite of scientific knowledge, Robert Proctor, who coined the term, distinguishes between ignorance actively produced—“made, maintained and manipulated,” and ignorance as an unintended consequence of the conditions that shape inquiry. In this seminar, we’ll discuss various manifestations of agnotology as related to the making of scientific knowledge. For example, we will learn about the strategies used by the tobacco industry during the mid-twentieth century to conceal and undermine research on the ill health effects of smoking, and how those same strategies were deployed decades later to cast doubt upon the science of global warming.

The questions that will guide our semester include: What are the shared commonalities - and differences - between generations related to relationships and intimacy? Is there a relationship between technology/invention/culture and intimacy/sex for college students? How have world events such as public health (i.e. STIs, HIV/AIDS) and political issues (i.e. war) directly impacted college students' and their sexual/romantic behaviors? Do on-campus institutions (such as the Greek system) influence social and sexual interactions amongst college students? In its role as in loco parentis, has the university socially engineered the campus environment in relation to students’ social behaviors? Has the university, as an entity, reasonably demonstrated responsiveness to changes in students’ behaviors?

       "  'description': 'At the birth of this nation, it was assumed by journalists and their readers that journalists were partisans, telling stories from particular points of view. But the growth of the modern newspaper combined with the ideals of science transformed the image, self-image, and practice of journalism, which now claims to worship at the altar of objectivity, to present information or “news” without bias. This ethic has carried over to the contemporary media, despite challenges from critics that include political power brokers that outspokenly seek to marginalize the press. In this course we examine this ideal or promise: is it possible? desirable? To pursue this inquiry we consider challenges to objectivity by figures such as Truman Capote, who linked a “new journalism” to a personal point of view, Robert McChesney, whose corporate media perspective provides a powerful macro analysis of modern journalism, and Jay Rosen, who articulates the postmodern shifts brought on by the Internet that have redefined and realigned the relationship between the journalist and audience.

       "  'description': 'Mannered, adorned, intricate, elusive, eccentric, subversive, reactionary—these are all qualities often associated with the Baroque aesthetic, a complex and resilient artistic movement that swept the European continent from the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries. While the Baroque may accommodate such labels, it also resists the fetters of definitions. In this course, we examine the controversies that animate the Baroque period: how did an aesthetic of excess come to inform architecture, politics, religion, the visual arts, and specifically for our intent, the theater? How might the Baroque period be considered a living tension between Ambiguity, closely associated with the Renaissance, and Hyperbole, understood here as monumentalism and dogmatism? We look at texts that embrace, but also decry the Baroque aesthetic turn, and we try to understand how this appetite for grandeur, for excess, for unbridled expressivity still mediates the sensibilities of our post-modernity. This course posits that the Baroque was neither a style nor a period, but a shift in sensibility, a philosophical veering, resolutely modern, that never left us. Alongside recent critical essays on the topic, we examine plays, prose and poetry, music and art by, among others, Shakespeare, Dryden, Burton, Donne, Corneille, Racine, Molière, Calderon, Aphra Behn, Montaigne; Monteverdi, Palestrina, Purcell and Vivaldi; Velasquez, Holbein, Caravaggio and Cranach.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'What does it mean to design democratically? This course explores some of the many ways of answering this question by crossing boundaries between architecture and urbanism, social science research, public realm process, and technology. In this course, we begin by considering the network of public spaces (from the city’s streets to its power supplies) in New York City as a system of functional and aesthetic interactions and a social reality. We turn, then, to the possibilities of design to intervene in this network. What does it mean for an urban space to reflect democraticness? How should we, as democratically-minded designers, think about the sometimes conflicting demands of civility and the pressures of a well-functioning city? How do we think about the tension between civility and democracy? How do we make sense of the way that calls for public space often come from city elites? Is it possible to use design to undermine power? Students will work in teams to define these conceptual problems and will make use of state-of-the-art technology and reflect on it to reimagine what a civic space might look like. While all students will write critical papers as well as work on design exercises using state-of-the-art software, students are asked to elect to enroll in one of two course code options; Option 1 (an Interdisciplinary Seminar, wherein major work completed is of the written type) or Option 2 (A Design Workshop, wherein major work completed is a design project).

       "  'description': 'In Jorge Luis Borges’s 1941 short story, \\xa0<em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em>\\xa0, a character named Ts’ Ui Pen seeks to build a labyrinth in which all men will lose their way. Borges reveals that labyrinth to be a sprawling book in which all moments in time are followed by every possible subsequent moment. Multiple futures and timelines exist as one in this garden of forking paths. Fast forward to today, where we find that Ts’ Ui Pen’s seemingly incomprehensible vision has come to fruition via video games and interactive fiction. Both often eschew linearity and instead offer users the opportunity to drive the story and shape their own narrative experience. In this course, we will first explore the trajectory of interactive fiction, from its early overtures in works by Borges and Italo Calvino, forward through Agusto Boal’s Forum Theatre, early computer text adventures, \\xa0<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>\\xa0 books, non-linear film, and into the various digital interactive fictions of today, such as hypertext literature, adventure games, and visual novels. From there, students will embark on their own adventure through interactive creative writing. The journey will begin with students taking apart and diagraming existing interactive works, and using digital tools to craft and share their own short interactive scenes and dialogs. We will confront the challenges and limitations of writing interactive story and establish some key critical theories governing non-linearity. The course will culminate in students designing and writing a complete short work of interactive fiction in a medium of their choice. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'The concepts of “cultural heritage” and “historic preservation” are capacious, including natural resources, man-made artifacts, monuments,\\n\\nfolklore, myth, and tradition. Most importantly, these concepts connect the past, present and future within a coherent narrative. The\\n\\nconstruction of this narrative itself is an ideologically and politically charged process. This is a history and theory based course that explores how and where this process occurs. How does it manifest itself in the spaces of museums, archaeological digs, sacred spaces, and tourist destinations? And how do these sites shape communities or nations? This seminar traces how global imperial projects of preservation and plunder filled the museums of London, Paris, and Rome. We explore how museums become contested sites of postcolonial nation-building, historical reckoning, and as a means of integrating traumatic events into our historical consciousness. Combining insights from history, museum studies, postcolonial studies, and urbanism, we examine how “cultural heritage” and “historic preservation” relate to the history of museums. How can museums be understood as political spaces shaped by national, colonial, and postcolonial forces? How do\\n\\ncolonial and postcolonial politics shape the processes of curation and “museumification?” We also visit museums in New York to discuss the\\n\\npower dynamics behind “museumification” in our own city. More informal writing assignments culminate in two formal research projects. The aim of assignments throughout the seminar is to hone critical thinking and writing skills, to disentangle concepts of “heritage,” and to explore\\n\\nhow museums helped build civilizations, empires, and modern-day nations. Readings may include Sir Walter Scott, Pierre Nora, Michel\\n\\nFoucault, Eric Hobsbawm, Benedict Anderson, Susan Crane, Timothy Michell, Tapati Guha-Thakurta, Nezar AlSayyad, and Alexander Stille.\\n\\n',\n",

Topics include disease and health in the ancient world, the origins and consequences of the Black Death, cholera in 19th century New York, disease and imperialism, the origins of AIDS, and a global history of malaria.

This course explores the rise and reign of Rome’s most remembered autocrats, Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus, analyzing the birth of the Roman empire from both contemporary and current perspectives. How did Caesar disrupt the traditional dynamics of Roman society? How did the rise of Augustus complicate Roman paradigms of power? And what can these ancient autocrats teach us about leadership and authority in the modern world? Together we examine these questions in context, including the notion of the Pax Romana and Pax Americana, considering also the relationship between power, state, and people within various facets of ancient and modern society. We will utilize both primary texts in translation and secondary sources on the reception of Caesarian politics and the ethics of empire. Readings include Vergil, Ovid, Shakespeare, Hannah Arendt, Duncan Kennedy, and Clifford Ando. A series of short writing assignments will prepare students to explore their historical or theoretical interests in a longer research paper. ',\n",

Our particular focus will be on the conversation between the films and social and political life in Cuba. Some questions that will guide our investigation follow: if the implementation of the Revolution required a new way of imagining one’s political, social, and economic self in relation to one’s larger community, what was cinema’s role in that imagination? How has Cuban cinema negotiated complex issues surrounding shifting socio-economic practices: for example, the radical increase in the number of women in the workforce; declarations of racial equality; and housing shortages? How did Cuban Cinema continue to provide a form and forum for debate about Cuba’s role in the world: for example, the US Embargo/Blockade, the war in Angola, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the influx of foreign tourists that began in the 1990s? We will view a wide range of filmic genres and forms: newsreels, documentaries, narrative features, as well as recent short and feature length films produced with new technology. We will also attend the screening of at least one film at the 18th Annual Havana Film Festival New York. In addition to weekly film viewings, readings about Cuban economic, social, and political life will be central to the course and will contribute to our understanding of the many changes that have taken place in Cuban culture and politics in the past fifty-seven years.

Is justice really only an effect of power, the right of the strong to define the terms under which the weak live? How are law and justice connected?

Are cultural and geographic variations of ethical concerns and means for addressing them inevitable and perhaps appropriate? We will explore the historical context, principles and practices of bioethics and global health, as well as their interrelationships. Other issues that we will discuss in this seminar include the social determinants of health, human rights, research ethics, HIV/AIDS, ethical issues at the end of life, and emergency/disaster relief. Throughout the course we will utilize case studies to compare and contrast bioethical dilemmas locally, nationally and internationally. Students will learn and apply a stepwise approach for conducting ethical analysis. Class activities will include simulated clinical bioethics committees, research ethics review committees as well as policy analysis and recommendations. Course readings will include scholarly articles and chapters from the medical and social science literature such as public health, political science and philosophy. Additionally, we will read from selected works of fiction that can inform and enrich our discussion of global bioethics including Camus’ \\xa0<em>The Plague</em>\\xa0 and Conrad’s \\xa0<em>The Heart of Darkness</em>\\xa0.\\n\\n\",\n",

What are the contours of Asian American political consciousness and movement? Using the lens of comparative racial formation, this seminar investigates Asian American political participation around contemporary issues such as immigration, multiracial coalitions, affirmative action, data disaggregation, detention and deportation, Islamophobia, intergenerational relations, and gentrification. This course will explore the political developments that gave rise to “Asian America” in the 1960s and probe deeper theoretical questions about the complexities and pluralities of the contemporary Asian American experience. We will also consider the role of American political institutions including the federal, state, and local governments, and how public policies at all levels come to shape the political lives of Asian Americans in the United States. Texts include Claire Jean Kim’s Bitter Fruit: The Politics of Black-Korean Conflict in New York City, Karen Ishizuka’s Serve the People: Making Asian America in the Long Sixties, Eric Tang’s Unsettled: Cambodian Refugees in the New York City Hyperghetto, and Monisha Das Gupta’s Unruly Immigrants: Rights, Activism, and Transnational South Asian Politics in the United States. As we read these texts, students will be exposed to intersectional, comparative, and emergent approaches to the study of race, culture, power, place, and politics. \\n\\n',\n",

She was one of the most acute readers of modern French culture and politics, and a regular contributor to debates on contemporary art and museum exhibitions. This seminar will analyze her work as a feminist, historian, reader of French culture and politics, and New Yorker, and will attend to its impact on subjects such as reality and its representation, feminism and masculinity, race and empire, poverty and privilege, the fragment and the canon. We will look at the strategies that characterized and made effective her work, including depth and breadth in erudition; sustained and close observation; and wit and clarity in writing. We will also study different genres of her interventions: the scholarly but accessible essay; the exhibition catalogue; the artist monograph; the exhibition and book review; and the ringing call to arms in the lecture hall.

It is writer’s persona, the sound of his or her presence. Voice is what persists, whispering in our head, long after the essayist's convictions are aired, long after we have closed the book, or closed the browser. This multigenre writing workshop will help hone an essential and potent element of your writing: an ability to adapt your voice to the medium. Whether it is the rigor of short fiction, the convictions of the personal essay or the quick musings of a blog, we will explore different ways to develop your voice. We will close-read published stories, essays, blogs as a starting point for your own writing. We will explore aspects of craft: point of view, character, theme, rhythm, structure and so on. We will burnish each other’s work with frank and constructive comment and grapple with the rigors of editing. The course will require close-readings of fiction by Kafka, Cortazar, Ha Jin, Lahiri, Oates, personal essays by Hemon, Dillard, Jo Ann Beard, Shteyngart and other writers. We will also study blogs like ze frank, Learningtoloveyoumore by Miranda July.

       "  'description': 'In Latin, the verb \\xa0<em>convertere</em>\\xa0, literally “to turn,” can refer both to the physical metamorphosis of an object or creature and to the translation of a text from one language to another; the same word also gives us our English vocabulary of religious conversion. This course will explore the relationships between these different kinds of transformation in four major works of Latin literature: Lucretius’s \\xa0<em>De Rerum Natura</em>\\xa0, Ovid’s \\xa0<em>Metamorphoses</em>\\xa0, Apuleius’s \\xa0<em>Golden Ass</em>\\xa0 and Augustine’s \\xa0<em>Confessions</em>\\xa0. Although these texts are very different from one another – they include a radically materialist philosophical poem, a mythological counter-epic, a picaresque novel whose narrator is magically turned into a donkey, and an autobiographical profession of Christian faith – they share a deep concern with the nature of personal identity and its relationship to writing. Over the course of the semester, we will track these common interests, while also situating each of our texts in its particular historical, social, and intellectual contexts; we will also want to consider the ways in which Latin literature’s persistent concern with transformation reflects the distinctive hybridity of Roman culture. Finally, all four of our texts played an important roles in the cultural transformations of the European Renaissance, so, in addition to our core Roman materials, we will also read works by later authors, including Petrarch, Montaigne, and Shakespeare. All readings will be in English.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'This two-unit course examines the relationship between law and political critique by looking at the possibilities and constraints that attach to legal speech as a species of dissent. Michel Foucault describes political critique as “the art of not being governed like that and at that cost”. Legal speech often has both the instrumental and performative role that Foucault’s description of political critique invokes – legal speech can have very particular consequences in demarcating the sanctioned space for critique of governance, while itself performing the art of critique. With a focus on these intertwined dimensions of legal speech, we read a series of cases for legal arguments about the appropriate space of resisting “being governed like \\xa0<em>that”</em>\\xa0, while also trying to understand those arguments as creating “the art of not being governed.” What is the relationship between the pragmatic and performative dimensions of dissent in law? What kind of ‘art of not being governed’ does legal speech enable and what does it close off? What can it privilege and legitimate, and what does it obscure and exclude? The class will engage with legal scholarship, social theory, judicial opinions, short stories and music lyrics addressing the terrain of law, speech and resistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Student teams will then use the results from these scientific and financial approaches to learn how to plan and implement practical conservation solutions that can be applied on the ground.

       "  'description': 'Despite predictions throughout the twentieth century that modernization and secularization went hand in hand with an inevitable decline of religion, the so-called “return of religion” in the late twentieth century called this thesis into question. Political and social shifts of the twenty first century have made it even more clear that to understand our world—its past, present, and future—we must understand religion. But what do we mean when we say religion has “returned” and what do we mean by “religion”? Is it a set of practices, a belief system, an ethnicity, or a cultural identity? This course will be based around the complex and ultimately unanswerable question, “what do we study when we study ‘religion’?” The course will include discussion of major world religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—as well as new religious movements, magic, atheism, and religious identifications such as “spiritual but not religious.” We will discuss religious studies as an academic discipline, the history of religion, sociological and anthropological approaches, the psychology of religion, feminist theory, the idea of “lived religion,” topics within popular culture and religion, and recent political characterizations and debates. Readings may include works by Tala Asad, Graham Harvey, William James, Mircea Eliade, J. Z. Smith, Robert Orsi, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Saba Mahmood, Charles Taylor, Russell McCutcheon, Jeffrey Stout,<strong> </strong>and Michael Warner.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': \"By giving us a sense of place, the city we inhabit recreates us. This documentary photography course explores New York City as the ever-changing environment in which we are involved. Embarking on a photographic project of their design, students depict a highly visible urban space (viewed as a world financial, cultural, artistic capital) through their own relationship to it: their ways of interacting, acting, and being moved. Classes prepare students to work on their position as photographers: as they make pictures in the streets of New York, they determine their own perception (vantage point, angle, point of view, framing) and establish a particular relationship with the audience (through scale, rhythm sequence, position, color). Exploring the boundaries between public and private space, feeling space and scale with the body (and not only with one's eyes) and creating a personal color palette are strongly encouraged. Students also explore a photographer's power to change audience perception, for example, through large scale installations inciting viewers to inhabit particular vantage points. Though documentary imagery is traditionally considered to establish a transparent relation to 'reality,' this course challenges students to recognize its created character and to recreate the city by influencing with their photographic intervention the ways it is perceived. Classes are highly collaborative, offering technical instruction, critiques of student work, debates on street photography, visual analysis and discussions with invited artists. Open to highly motivated students with or without experience in documentary photography; digital or film cameras welcome. \\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This course uses social analysis, political speeches, and fiction to explore the relation of race-making, nation-building, and story-telling in the case of the United States. Our broadest premise is that collective subjects (nations, peoples, classes, religions, races) are formed and reformed thorugh narratives and collective action. Our specific premise is that \"American\" nationhood has been formed by racial domination and opposition to it, as represented in contesting narratives. Our goal is two-fold: to assess racialized nationalism in its historic and recent iterations, but also to assess how it is contested differently by scholarly treatises, political speeches, and works of literary and cinematic invention. Part one uses social analysis to explore the intersections entwining settler colonialism, chattel slavery, and immigration restriction, in forming American society and an imagined (\"American\") national community. the practice and meaning of democracy has been set by white supremacy in each regard, but democracy has also been enlarged and remade by social movements and counter-narratives that re-conceive the meaning of both race and nation. Part Two thus uses speeches by activists to clarify the debates in the civil rights era about the goals, means and stories that define effective social change. Part Three compares how fictions in literature and film represent the relation of race, nation, and democratic possibility. Authors include James Baldwin, Toni Morrisoon, Colson Whitehead, Claudia Rankine. Theorists include Michael Rogin, Audra Simpson, Mae Ngai, Hortense Spillers, Saidiyah Hartman, Frank Wilderson, Fred Moten. Films include Bamboozled, GET OUT, and Black Panther. \\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': \"This course will consider the history of the idea of ‘World Literature’ from its first use in early 19th century Germany to describe the achievements of global literary history to its use today to describe an approach to novels from diverse contexts that focuses on the representation of migration, translation, and circulation. We will survey this history by considering the evolving idea of ‘the world’ itself, from Enlightenment articulations to studies of the world economy to crucial 20th century and contemporary interventions, tracing the shifting meanings of 'the world’ in relation to contemporaneous works that have been seen as representative of 'World Literature.’ In the last third of the semester we will read and discuss recent novels and critical studies engaged with modern understandings of the term 'World Literature.’ Fictional texts will include works by Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Nadine Gordimer, Franz Kafka, Arundhati Roy, and Zadie Smith. Theoretical texts will include Goethe’s writings on “Weltliteratur,” Kant’s \\xa0<em>Political Writings</em>\\xa0, Hegel’s \\xa0<em>Introduction to the Philosophy of History</em>\\xa0, selections from Marx’s \\xa0<em>Capital</em>\\xa0, Fanon’s \\xa0<em>Black Skin, White Masks</em>\\xa0, Heidegger's \\xa0<em>Poetry Language Thought</em>\\xa0, Emily Apter’s \\xa0<em>Against World Literature</em>\\xa0, and essays on World Literature by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, David Damrosch, Franco Moretti, Debjani Ganguly, and Pheng Cheah.\",\n",

Students will read primary and secondary texts by philosophers, physicians, theologians, jurists, tragedians, novelists, psychologists, social reformers, policy makers, journalists, historians and individuals who suffered madness.

       "  'description': '“If you put on anarchist glasses,\" writes political scientist James C. Scott in his book Two Cheers for Anarchism, “and look at the history of popular movements, revolutions, ordinary politics and the state from that angle, certain insights will appear that are obscured from almost any other angle.” Using an “anarchist squint,” Scott argues, allows us to better understand more clearly informal order, submerged politics, informal regulation of markets and commons, resistance to the state, subversion of legal regimes, and other topics. In can show us, in other words, the ways that people have built order, regulated their lives, and resisted domination in ways outside and against the state. The idea of this seminar is to adopt such an “anarchist squint” and take anarchism as method for students’ varied work. We will spend the term reading scholarship about communities, property, the state, law, and power to test the utility of an “anarchist squint” for our own work. Authors may include Scott, Colin Ward, Patricia Erick and Susan Silby, Elinor Ostrom, David Graeber, and others. Familiarity or affinity with political anarchism are unnecessary but welcome.',\n",

While somewhat privileged in terms or race and class, the protagonists of these books find their artistic and intellectual ambitions shaped and thwarted by the limitations of gender at every turn. And through these characters (or so \\xa0<em>Madwoman</em>\\xa0 argued) the authors expressed their own struggles—as “women”--to find a public voice when few women enjoyed the right to vote, attend university, own property, or sign contracts. In addition to these novels and \\xa0<em>Madwoman</em>\\xa0 itself, we will read selected poetry by Plath, Emily Dickinson, and Audre Lorde; essays on “women artists” by Eliot and Linda Nochlin; and critical responses by by Gayatri Spivak, bell hooks, and Susan Fraiman.

The tutorial group meets regularly throughout the semester, and students follow a common syllabus: all participants complete the same readings, write papers on similar topics, etc. Students in the same tutorial must register for the same number of credits. Credit is determined by the amount of work (readings and other types of assignments) and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Tutorials range from 2 to 4 credits.

Participants develop a solo performance through a series of exercises using memory, movement and written and visual imagery, and explore the associative strategies of collage and pastiche as methodologies for structuring material. The solos emerge from a process involving improvisation (movement and text), composing, and revision of material. Readings include performance texts by prominent artists, essays on performance, and video viewings, which foreground the tendency in performance to explore subjectivity and identity in light of social and political critique. Required texts include Jo Bonney’s \\xa0<em>Extreme Exposure</em>\\xa0, C. Carr\\'s \\xa0<em>On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century</em>\\xa0, and Lenora Champagne’s \\xa0<em>Out from Under: Texts by Women Performance Artists</em>\\xa0. Additional readings include Colin Counsell, \"Postmodernism and Performance Art,\" Roselee Goldberg, \"Performance: A Hidden History,\" Jonathan Kalb, \"Documentary Solo Performance: The Politics of the Mirrored Self,\" and an essay by Coco Fusco. Assignments include a solo performance created from the material developed in class (rather than \"polishing\" an already created piece), along with a written analysis of two live solo performances, and an oral presentation.

Over seven thousand miles of sewers undergird the five boroughs of New York; centuries of occluded catastrophe dictate the architectural fabric of modern London; and in metropolises around the world the labor of an unacknowledged precariat lets us pass through the urban everyday without reflection. This course looks at how these invisible cities are made visible through literature. We’ll grapple with the pathological, the potential, the evanescent, and even the scatological, as we ask how literature maps on to hidden registers of the built environment. Alongside conventional exercises in essay writing, research, and in-class presentations, students can expect to put theory into practice with assignments involving urban exploration, literary fieldwork, and urban audition. Writing requirements will include formal papers responding to readings; an exploration journal linking texts and experiences; construction of a city itinerary (and corresponding reaction to a classmate’s); and a final research project (which can, with permission, incorporate creative elements). Events at the Morbid Anatomy Museum and excursions with the Atlas Obscura collective may be arranged.

       "  'description': 'Science studies scholars traditionally think about knowledge: how it is produced, validated, translates across domains (or not), and intersects with other aspects of social, material, cultural, and political life. Yet, the doing of science can produce more than just knowledge. The term “agnotology” describes the production of ignorance, and the study of that production. While ignorance is often contrasted as the opposite of scientific knowledge, Robert Proctor, who coined the term, distinguishes between ignorance actively produced—“made, maintained and manipulated,” and ignorance as an unintended consequence of the conditions that shape inquiry. In this seminar, we’ll discuss various manifestations of agnotology as related to the making of scientific knowledge. For example, we will learn about the strategies used by the tobacco industry during the mid-twentieth century to conceal and undermine research on the ill health effects of smoking, and how those same strategies were deployed decades later to cast doubt upon the science of global warming.

The questions that will guide our semester include: What are the shared commonalities - and differences - between generations related to relationships and intimacy? Is there a relationship between technology/invention/culture and intimacy/sex for college students? How have world events such as public health (i.e. STIs, HIV/AIDS) and political issues (i.e. war) directly impacted college students' and their sexual/romantic behaviors? Do on-campus institutions (such as the Greek system) influence social and sexual interactions amongst college students? In its role as in loco parentis, has the university socially engineered the campus environment in relation to students’ social behaviors? Has the university, as an entity, reasonably demonstrated responsiveness to changes in students’ behaviors? Using the lenses of educator and public health practitioner we will explore how universities responded to their students’ sexuality including adapting to co-education campuses, marriage preparation, sexuality education, Queer friendly campuses and informed consent.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'description': 'At the birth of this nation, it was assumed by journalists and their readers that journalists were partisans, telling stories from particular points of view. But the growth of the modern newspaper combined with the ideals of science transformed the image, self-image, and practice of journalism, which now claims to worship at the altar of objectivity, to present information or “news” without bias. This ethic has carried over to the contemporary media, despite challenges from critics that include political power brokers that outspokenly seek to marginalize the press. In this course we examine this ideal or promise: is it possible? desirable? To pursue this inquiry we consider challenges to objectivity by figures such as Truman Capote, who linked a “new journalism” to a personal point of view, Robert McChesney, whose corporate media perspective provides a powerful macro analysis of modern journalism, and Jay Rosen, who articulates the postmodern shifts brought on by the Internet that have redefined and realigned the relationship between the journalist and audience.

       "  'description': 'Mannered, adorned, intricate, elusive, eccentric, subversive, reactionary—these are all qualities often associated with the Baroque aesthetic, a complex and resilient artistic movement that swept the European continent from the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries. While the Baroque may accommodate such labels, it also resists the fetters of definitions. In this course, we examine the controversies that animate the Baroque period: how did an aesthetic of excess come to inform architecture, politics, religion, the visual arts, and specifically for our intent, the theater? How might the Baroque period be considered a living tension between Ambiguity, closely associated with the Renaissance, and Hyperbole, understood here as monumentalism and dogmatism? We look at texts that embrace, but also decry the Baroque aesthetic turn, and we try to understand how this appetite for grandeur, for excess, for unbridled expressivity still mediates the sensibilities of our post-modernity. This course posits that the Baroque was neither a style nor a period, but a shift in sensibility, a philosophical veering, resolutely modern, that never left us. Alongside recent critical essays on the topic, we examine plays, prose and poetry, music and art by, among others, Shakespeare, Dryden, Burton, Donne, Corneille, Racine, Molière, Calderon, Aphra Behn, Montaigne; Monteverdi, Palestrina, Purcell and Vivaldi; Velasquez, Holbein, Caravaggio and Cranach.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'What does it mean to design democratically? This course explores some of the many ways of answering this question by crossing boundaries between architecture and urbanism, social science research, public realm process, and technology. In this course, we begin by considering the network of public spaces (from the city’s streets to its power supplies) in New York City as a system of functional and aesthetic interactions and a social reality. We turn, then, to the possibilities of design to intervene in this network. What does it mean for an urban space to reflect democraticness? How should we, as democratically-minded designers, think about the sometimes conflicting demands of civility and the pressures of a well-functioning city? How do we think about the tension between civility and democracy? How do we make sense of the way that calls for public space often come from city elites? Is it possible to use design to undermine power? Students will work in teams to define these conceptual problems and will make use of state-of-the-art technology and reflect on it to reimagine what a civic space might look like. While all students will write critical papers as well as work on design exercises using state-of-the-art software, students are asked to elect to enroll in one of two course code options; Option 1 (an Interdisciplinary Seminar, wherein major work completed is of the written type) or Option 2 (A Design Workshop, wherein major work completed is a design project).

       "  'description': 'In Jorge Luis Borges’s 1941 short story, \\xa0<em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em>\\xa0, a character named Ts’ Ui Pen seeks to build a labyrinth in which all men will lose their way. Borges reveals that labyrinth to be a sprawling book in which all moments in time are followed by every possible subsequent moment. Multiple futures and timelines exist as one in this garden of forking paths. Fast forward to today, where we find that Ts’ Ui Pen’s seemingly incomprehensible vision has come to fruition via video games and interactive fiction. Both often eschew linearity and instead offer users the opportunity to drive the story and shape their own narrative experience. In this course, we will first explore the trajectory of interactive fiction, from its early overtures in works by Borges and Italo Calvino, forward through Agusto Boal’s Forum Theatre, early computer text adventures, \\xa0<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>\\xa0 books, non-linear film, and into the various digital interactive fictions of today, such as hypertext literature, adventure games, and visual novels. From there, students will embark on their own adventure through interactive creative writing. The journey will begin with students taking apart and diagraming existing interactive works, and using digital tools to craft and share their own short interactive scenes and dialogs. We will confront the challenges and limitations of writing interactive story and establish some key critical theories governing non-linearity. The course will culminate in students designing and writing a complete short work of interactive fiction in a medium of their choice. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'The concepts of “cultural heritage” and “historic preservation” are capacious, including natural resources, man-made artifacts, monuments,\\n\\nfolklore, myth, and tradition. Most importantly, these concepts connect the past, present and future within a coherent narrative. The\\n\\nconstruction of this narrative itself is an ideologically and politically charged process. This is a history and theory based course that explores how and where this process occurs. How does it manifest itself in the spaces of museums, archaeological digs, sacred spaces, and tourist destinations? And how do these sites shape communities or nations? This seminar traces how global imperial projects of preservation and plunder filled the museums of London, Paris, and Rome. We explore how museums become contested sites of postcolonial nation-building, historical reckoning, and as a means of integrating traumatic events into our historical consciousness. Combining insights from history, museum studies, postcolonial studies, and urbanism, we examine how “cultural heritage” and “historic preservation” relate to the history of museums. How can museums be understood as political spaces shaped by national, colonial, and postcolonial forces? How do\\n\\ncolonial and postcolonial politics shape the processes of curation and “museumification?” We also visit museums in New York to discuss the\\n\\npower dynamics behind “museumification” in our own city. More informal writing assignments culminate in two formal research projects. The aim of assignments throughout the seminar is to hone critical thinking and writing skills, to disentangle concepts of “heritage,” and to explore\\n\\nhow museums helped build civilizations, empires, and modern-day nations. Readings may include Sir Walter Scott, Pierre Nora, Michel\\n\\nFoucault, Eric Hobsbawm, Benedict Anderson, Susan Crane, Timothy Michell, Tapati Guha-Thakurta, Nezar AlSayyad, and Alexander Stille.\\n\\n',\n",

Topics include disease and health in the ancient world, the origins and consequences of the Black Death, cholera in 19th century New York, disease and imperialism, the origins of AIDS, and a global history of malaria.

This course explores the rise and reign of Rome’s most remembered autocrats, Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus, analyzing the birth of the Roman empire from both contemporary and current perspectives. How did Caesar disrupt the traditional dynamics of Roman society? How did the rise of Augustus complicate Roman paradigms of power? And what can these ancient autocrats teach us about leadership and authority in the modern world? Together we examine these questions in context, including the notion of the Pax Romana and Pax Americana, considering also the relationship between power, state, and people within various facets of ancient and modern society. We will utilize both primary texts in translation and secondary sources on the reception of Caesarian politics and the ethics of empire. Readings include Vergil, Ovid, Shakespeare, Hannah Arendt, Duncan Kennedy, and Clifford Ando. A series of short writing assignments will prepare students to explore their historical or theoretical interests in a longer research paper. ',\n",

Our particular focus will be on the conversation between the films and social and political life in Cuba. Some questions that will guide our investigation follow: if the implementation of the Revolution required a new way of imagining one’s political, social, and economic self in relation to one’s larger community, what was cinema’s role in that imagination? How has Cuban cinema negotiated complex issues surrounding shifting socio-economic practices: for example, the radical increase in the number of women in the workforce; declarations of racial equality; and housing shortages? How did Cuban Cinema continue to provide a form and forum for debate about Cuba’s role in the world: for example, the US Embargo/Blockade, the war in Angola, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the influx of foreign tourists that began in the 1990s? We will view a wide range of filmic genres and forms: newsreels, documentaries, narrative features, as well as recent short and feature length films produced with new technology. We will also attend the screening of at least one film at the 18th Annual Havana Film Festival New York. In addition to weekly film viewings, readings about Cuban economic, social, and political life will be central to the course and will contribute to our understanding of the many changes that have taken place in Cuban culture and politics in the past fifty-seven years.

It also represents justice as tied to a state of equilibrium, which can be completely restored. Yet justice itself is very difficult to define, shifting its meanings over time, between cultures and among individuals; can we presume such a balance? Is justice really only an effect of power, the right of the strong to define the terms under which the weak live? How are law and justice connected?

       "  'description': 'What does the growing population of Asian Americans mean for the landscape of American politics? What are the contours of Asian American political consciousness and movement? Using the lens of comparative racial formation, this seminar investigates Asian American political participation around contemporary issues such as immigration, multiracial coalitions, affirmative action, data disaggregation, detention and deportation, Islamophobia, intergenerational relations, and gentrification. This course will explore the political developments that gave rise to “Asian America” in the 1960s and probe deeper theoretical questions about the complexities and pluralities of the contemporary Asian American experience. We will also consider the role of American political institutions including the federal, state, and local governments, and how public policies at all levels come to shape the political lives of Asian Americans in the United States. Texts include Claire Jean Kim’s Bitter Fruit: The Politics of Black-Korean Conflict in New York City, Karen Ishizuka’s Serve the People: Making Asian America in the Long Sixties, Eric Tang’s Unsettled: Cambodian Refugees in the New York City Hyperghetto, and Monisha Das Gupta’s Unruly Immigrants: Rights, Activism, and Transnational South Asian Politics in the United States. As we read these texts, students will be exposed to intersectional, comparative, and emergent approaches to the study of race, culture, power, place, and politics. \\n\\n',\n",

She was one of the most acute readers of modern French culture and politics, and a regular contributor to debates on contemporary art and museum exhibitions. This seminar will analyze her work as a feminist, historian, reader of French culture and politics, and New Yorker, and will attend to its impact on subjects such as reality and its representation, feminism and masculinity, race and empire, poverty and privilege, the fragment and the canon. We will look at the strategies that characterized and made effective her work, including depth and breadth in erudition; sustained and close observation; and wit and clarity in writing. We will also study different genres of her interventions: the scholarly but accessible essay; the exhibition catalogue; the artist monograph; the exhibition and book review; and the ringing call to arms in the lecture hall.

It is writer’s persona, the sound of his or her presence. Voice is what persists, whispering in our head, long after the essayist's convictions are aired, long after we have closed the book, or closed the browser. This multigenre writing workshop will help hone an essential and potent element of your writing: an ability to adapt your voice to the medium. Whether it is the rigor of short fiction, the convictions of the personal essay or the quick musings of a blog, we will explore different ways to develop your voice. We will close-read published stories, essays, blogs as a starting point for your own writing. We will explore aspects of craft: point of view, character, theme, rhythm, structure and so on. We will burnish each other’s work with frank and constructive comment and grapple with the rigors of editing. The course will require close-readings of fiction by Kafka, Cortazar, Ha Jin, Lahiri, Oates, personal essays by Hemon, Dillard, Jo Ann Beard, Shteyngart and other writers. We will also study blogs like ze frank, Learningtoloveyoumore by Miranda July.

       "  'description': 'In Latin, the verb \\xa0<em>convertere</em>\\xa0, literally “to turn,” can refer both to the physical metamorphosis of an object or creature and to the translation of a text from one language to another; the same word also gives us our English vocabulary of religious conversion. This course will explore the relationships between these different kinds of transformation in four major works of Latin literature: Lucretius’s \\xa0<em>De Rerum Natura</em>\\xa0, Ovid’s \\xa0<em>Metamorphoses</em>\\xa0, Apuleius’s \\xa0<em>Golden Ass</em>\\xa0 and Augustine’s \\xa0<em>Confessions</em>\\xa0. Although these texts are very different from one another – they include a radically materialist philosophical poem, a mythological counter-epic, a picaresque novel whose narrator is magically turned into a donkey, and an autobiographical profession of Christian faith – they share a deep concern with the nature of personal identity and its relationship to writing. Over the course of the semester, we will track these common interests, while also situating each of our texts in its particular historical, social, and intellectual contexts; we will also want to consider the ways in which Latin literature’s persistent concern with transformation reflects the distinctive hybridity of Roman culture. Finally, all four of our texts played an important roles in the cultural transformations of the European Renaissance, so, in addition to our core Roman materials, we will also read works by later authors, including Petrarch, Montaigne, and Shakespeare. All readings will be in English.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'This two-unit course examines the relationship between law and political critique by looking at the possibilities and constraints that attach to legal speech as a species of dissent. Michel Foucault describes political critique as “the art of not being governed like that and at that cost”. Legal speech often has both the instrumental and performative role that Foucault’s description of political critique invokes – legal speech can have very particular consequences in demarcating the sanctioned space for critique of governance, while itself performing the art of critique. With a focus on these intertwined dimensions of legal speech, we read a series of cases for legal arguments about the appropriate space of resisting “being governed like \\xa0<em>that”</em>\\xa0, while also trying to understand those arguments as creating “the art of not being governed.” What is the relationship between the pragmatic and performative dimensions of dissent in law? What kind of ‘art of not being governed’ does legal speech enable and what does it close off? What can it privilege and legitimate, and what does it obscure and exclude? The class will engage with legal scholarship, social theory, judicial opinions, short stories and music lyrics addressing the terrain of law, speech and resistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Students will work in teams to select a site-based project from a menu of real world project options and design practical and achievable solutions to these risks and threats.We will use tools from the biology, earth sciences, anthropology, social psychology, economics, and business to determine the cause, magnitude, and urgency of threats. Student teams will then use the results from these scientific and financial approaches to learn how to plan and implement practical conservation solutions that can be applied on the ground. We will also use the skills and insights from the arts and communication media to tell the story of conservation needs, and build commitment by a wide spectrum of society to get the work done to resolve them. \\n\\n',\n",

We will consider: how individuals are formed by history and with regard to the future; the diversity of ideas about what “individuals” are and whether they even exist; the influence of culture and society upon the shaping of individuals; the “individual” as a political entity endowed (or not) with “inalienable rights”; locating or losing the “individual” within the panoply of newer ways of talking about “subjectivity” and “subjects”; the mediated individual—how people are creatures and producers within different media; whether truth and beauty exist only in the “eye of the beholder”; the concept of “the individual” in relation to current identity debates and affect theories. The class syllabus will group literary works with philosophical texts in relation to culture and period—for example, works by Aristotle, Plato, and Sophocles; Machiavelli and Shakespeare; Rousseau, Jefferson, Kant, and (Mary) Shelley); Douglass, Marx, and Mill; Nietzsche, Freud, and Cather; de Beauvoir, Fanon, and Truffaut; Baldwin, Foucault, Morrison, and Butler.
